Just starting a dotfiles git repo so I can use this across installations.

It's pretty basic and I might add things here, but generally everything here is really all I use for the most part.
Comes with an install script which just installs some packages and copies some directories to where they need to be. But this assumes Fedora. Because I use Fedora.
